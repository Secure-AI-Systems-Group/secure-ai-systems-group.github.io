                                The learning objective of this homework is for you to understand the basics of network traffic and packet analysis. You will be required to capture <code>DNS</code> and <code>HTTP/HTTPS</code> packets using <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank">Wireshark</a> and analyze them.
                            </p>

                                To begin with, you are required to install Wireshark. You need to have access to a computer that support both Wireshark and the <code>libpcap</code> library. Wireshark is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download the latest version from the official website [<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/download.html" target="_blank">link</a>]. Your operating system (OS) may have the libpcap software installed. If you face an issue with the libpcap library, you can install it as follows, depending on your OS:<br/>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>

                                <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Running Wireshark</h5>

                                When you run the Wireshark program, the Wireshark GUI shown in <a href="resources/main_wireshark.png" target="_blank">this figure (on Mac)</a> will be displayed. Initially, you can see the list of network interfaces on your computer, and a time-series diagram of the packets coming in and going out from the interface will be shown.<br/><br/>

                                Now you are ready to do a test drive!<br/>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Step 1:</b> Start Wireshark and select the network interface (e.g., eth0) you want to capture packets from. You can do this by clicking on the <code>Capture</code> menu and selecting <code>Options</code>.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Step 2:</b> Click on the <code>Start</code> button to begin capturing packets. You should see packets being displayed in the packet-listing window.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Step 3:</b> To filter the captured packets, enter a protocol name or other criteria in the packet-display filter field. For example, you can enter <code>http</code> to display only HTTP packets, as shown in <a href="resources/capture_wireshark.png" target="_blank">this figure</a>.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Step 4:</b> To stop capturing packets, click on the <code>Capture</code> menu and select <code>Stop</code>. You can also click on the <span style="color: #D73F09;">red square button</span> in the toolbar.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Step 5:</b> To save the captured packets, click on the <code>File</code> menu and select <code>Save As</code>. Choose a location and file name to save the captured packets.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Step 6:</b> To analyze the captured packets, select a packet in the packet-listing window. The details of the selected packet will be displayed in the packet-header details window and the packet-contents window.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Step 7:</b> You can expand or minimize the details of the packet by clicking on the arrowhead to the left of the protocol name in the packet-header details window. This will show you more information about the packet, such as the source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol-specific information.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                    Open Wireshark and enter <code>ip.addr == your_IP_address</code> into the filter, where you obtain your IP address (the IP address for the computer running Wireshark) with <code>ipconfig</code>. This filter removes all packets that neither originate nor are destined for your host.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Step 4:</b>
                                    Start packet capture in Wireshark.

                            <!-- :: Introduction -->
                            <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Homework Overview</h5>
                            <p>
                                The learning objectives of this homework are for students to gain hands-on experience with <code>buffer overflow</code> attacks. These attacks exploit a buffer overrun vulnerability in a program, causing it to bypass its usual execution sequence and instead jump to alternative code (typically launching a shell!). The attack overflows the vulnerable buffer to introduce the alternative code onto the stack and modifies the return address to point to that code.
                            </p>


                            <!-- :: Setup -->
                            <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Initial Setup</h5>
                            <p>
                                To begin, you are required to use a Linux machine with <code>sudo</code> privileges. You should not complete this homework on a shared server or any OSU computing clusters. If you perform a buffer overflow attack in these shared environments, you will be responsible for any consequences, and the instructor will not be liable. Note that you cannot run this on a Mac or Windows laptop. While these systems support command-line environments, they do not allow you to execute buffer overflow attacks. If you do not have a Linux machine, the instructor recommends creating a virtual machine using a commodity virtualization software, such as VMWare.<br/><br/>

                                "One way to bypass the configuration hassles is to set up your own server using a popular cloud provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS). To do this, sign up for AWS, go to the AWS Console, and select EC2. Then, launch an instance, choosing the operating system <code>Ubuntu 22.04</code> and the instance type <code>t2.micro</code> (which is eligible for the free tier). You will also need to configure an SSH key and a Security Group. Once completed, you can find the server's IP address in the console. Use that IP to log in to the cloud server via your terminal.

                                <pre><code>
                                    $ ssh -i "your-aws-key" ubuntu@"your-server-ip"
                                </code></pre>

                                To run the code provided by the instructor, you will need to install a few packages, as listed below. Note that you may need to install more packages. In such cases, you can easily search the error message shown in the terminal on Google and find the answers.

                                <pre><code>
                                    $ sudo apt install cmake gcc g++ gdb
                                    $ sudo apt install vim-enhanced
                                    $ sudo apt install python3
                                </code></pre>

                                Many countermeasures, such as ASLR, have been developed to address buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Circumventing these defenses is not as easy as it may seem, so we will disable them for this homework assignment. You can do so by following these steps:

                                <pre><code>
                                    $ sudo -i
                                    # sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0
                                    # exit      // exit the sudo; our assignment should be done in the user space.
                                </code></pre>

                                <b style="color: #D73F09;">[Important Note] Once you complete the homework, be sure to turn off and delete the cloud server to avoid being charged.</b>

                            You can now compile the bof.c file by running the <code>make</code> command. Once compiled, you are ready to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability. The code by default, will print out the flag <code>cs578{fakeflag}</code>. Your job is to exploit the buffer overflow and force it to print out <code>cs578{trueflag}</code>.

                            Now that you are familiar with buffer overflow exploitation, the instructor has prepared a fun task for you—running an arbitrary function that the program cannot execute normally. In this case, the function is the <code>bash shell</code>! (wait what?) Use the exact same program that the Instructor provided above and work hard to get a shell.<br/><br/>

                            <span style="color: #D73F09;">Tip: Python "print" may not work in some cases, e.g., it could add some termination characters like \x00. Please look for some other ways to write the address to the buffer. The instructor would not respond to any questions regarding this tip; it is the part of the homework assignment.</span>

                            <!-- :: Introduction -->
                            <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Homework Overview</h5>
                            <p>
                                The learning objective of this homework is for students to gain first-hand experience with <code>timing side-channel attacks</code>. These attacks exploit shared resources, such as cache memory shared between processors, causing the time it takes to execute an algorithm to become data-dependent. For example, if one program accesses certain data and a subsequent attacker accesses the same data, the retrieval time will be faster. By tracing such timing differences, an attacker can weaken the confidentiality of security-critical operations, such as cryptographic operations.

                            <!-- :: Setup -->
                            <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Initial Setup</h5>
                            <p>
                                You are required to use a Linux machine with <code>sudo</code> privileges. Note that <code>sudo</code> access is only needed to install the necessary packages; you won't be required sudo (or root) privileges to conduct the attack itself. You should not run this homework on a shared server or any OSU computing clusters. If you perform the attacks in these shared environments, you will be responsible for any consequences, and the instructor will not be held liable.<br/><br/>
                                
                                It may be challenging to run this on a Mac or Windows laptop (Note that the instructor did not try this. If you use these machines, it will be your challenges!). If you do not have a Linux machine, the instructor recommends creating an <code>Ubuntu 22.04</code> virtual machine using a commodity virtualization software, such as VMWare.<br/><br/>
                                
                                One way to bypass the configuration hassles is to set up your own server using a popular cloud provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS). To do this, sign up for AWS, go to the AWS Console, and select EC2. Then, launch an instance, choosing the operating system <code>Ubuntu 22.04</code> and the instance type <code>t2.micro</code> (which is eligible for the free tier). You will also need to configure an SSH key and a Security Group. Once completed, you can find the server's IP address in the console. Use that IP to log in to the cloud server via your terminal.

                                <pre style="text-align: left; white-space: pre-line;"><code>
                                    $ ssh -i "your-aws-key" ubuntu@"your-server-ip"
                                </code></pre>

                                To run the code provided by the instructor, you will need to install a few packages, as listed below. Note that you may need to install more packages. In such cases, you can easily search the error message shown in the terminal on Google and find the answers.

                                <pre style="text-align: left; white-space: pre-line;"><code>
                                    $ sudo apt install cmake gcc g++ gdb
                                    $ sudo apt install vim-enhanced
                                    $ sudo apt install python3
                                    $ sudo apt-get install binutils-dev libdwarf-dev libelf-dev
                                </code></pre>

                                N0w we are ready to run a side-channel attack. The specific attack we will explore is <code>Flush+Reload</code>, a timing side-channel technique based on the <code>L3 cache</code>. More details about this attack can be found in the original research paper. This paper is included in our reading list, and I encourage you to read it to understand the core concepts behind the attack. Don't worry—you will not need to implement the attack from scratch. Instead, we will use an existing implementation provided by the research community: <a href="https://github.com/Secure-AI-Systems-Group/CS578-HW3" target="_blank">Mastik</a>. Please follow the instructions in the <code>README.md</code> file to install Mastik on your machine.<br/><br/>

                                <b style="color: #D73F09;">[Important Note] Once you complete the homework, be sure to turn off and delete the cloud server to avoid being charged.</b>

                            <!-- :: Task I -->
                            <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Task I: Reconnaissance</h5>

                            In this task, you will learn how to gather information about the target system. This is a crucial step in any attack, as it allows you to understand the system's architecture and identify potential vulnerabilities. You will also learn how to measure the latency of memory accesses, which is essential for cache-based timing side-channel attacks.<br/><br/>

                            <b>Task I-1 (3 pts).</b>
                            The first subtask is to understand the environment in which you will run the attack. To do this, you may find the following Unix commands helpful: <code>lscpu</code>, <code>cat /proc/cpuinfo</code>, and <code>getconf -a | grep CACHE</code>. Now, answer the following questions:<br/><br/>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How many cores does your CPU have?</li>
                                <li>How many threads does your CPU have?</li>
                                <li>What is the size of the L1, L2, and L3 caches?</li>
                                <li>What is the size of the memory on your machine?</li>
                                <li>What is the L3 cache line size of your CPU?</li>
                                <li>What is the L3 cache associativity (i.e., the number of ways) of your CPU?</li>
                            </ul>
                            

                            <b>Task I-2 (3 pts).</b>
                            Now, let's measure the latency difference between accessing data in L3-cache vs. memory. Your task is to examine the code in <code>demo/FR-threshold.c</code> and interpret the terminal output after running the program. The code is composed of multiple blocks, starting from Line 38, 41, 45, 50, 56, 64, 66, and 76. You first need to explain the overall purpose of this program, what it is designed to measure or demonstrate. Then for each code block, describe what the block does and why it is needed to achieve the program's objective.

                            
                            <!-- :: Task II -->
                            <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Task II: Flush+Reload on Leaking Program Behaviors</h5>

                            Now that you are familiar with cache behavior, which means you are ready to run the Flush+Reload attack (isn't it fun?!). The Flush+Reload attack is a powerful side-channel attack that exploits the timing differences between accessing data from the cache vs. main memory. By precisely measuring these timing differences, an attacker can infer sensitive information about a target program's behavior, such as secret keys.<br/><br/>

                            <b>Prerequisites:</b> Navigate to the <code>task</code> folder prepared by the instructor (for you!). You can compile the code using the provided <code>Makefile</code>. The folder contains two programs—<code>attack</code> and <code>multiply</code>—as well as a shared library <code>libops.so</code>.<br/><br/>
                            
                            The <code>multiply</code> program performs a series of 2D matrix multiplication operations using the shared library. Do not worry about data input—the program automatically reads the two csv files, <code>operand1.csv</code> and <code>operand2.csv</code>, which contains the input matrices.<br/><br/>

                            The <code>attack.c</code> file contains the implementation of our Flush+Reload attack. This program is designed to infer the number of 2D matrix multiplication operations performed by the <code>multiply</code> program. It uses the Flush+Reload technique to measure timing differences between accessing data from the cache and from main memory. You do not need to run the two programs manually. The instructor has prepared a <code>run.sh</code> script for you. Simply execute this script—it will automate the process and save the attack outputs in the traces folder. These steps can be done as follows:<br/>

                            <pre style="text-align: left; white-space: pre-line;"><code>
                                $ make clean; make      // clean the previous build and compile the code
                                $ ./run.sh              // run the attack
                            </code></pre>

                            <b>Task II-2 (5 pts).</b>
                            
                            Now let's infer how many 2D matrix multiplication operations were performed by the multiply program. Note that in this task, extracting the exact number of operations is not the primary objective—you can simply reverse-engineer the multiply program to determine that. What's more important is to understand (1) the steps and configurations required to make the Flush+Reload attack work, and (2) how to analyze the outputs produced by the attack.<br/><br/>

                            Start by opening the output traces stored under the <code>traces</code> folder. Check how many times a cache-hit occurs. The number of cache-hits can serve as an important clue for approximating how many 2D matrix multiplication operations were performed by the <code>multiply</code> program. You may not be able to find the exact number of operations. Please feel free to run the <code>run.sh</code> multiple times until the number of observed cache-hits closely matches the number of 2D matrix multiplication operations you reverse-engineered from the <code>multiply</code> program. You may need to use different configurations for the followings when you make it work:

                            <pre style="text-align: left; white-space: pre-line;"><code>
                                Line 25: #define CPU_FREQ      2300000000
                                Line 26: #define SECONDS       4
                                Line 27: #define IDLE_SECONDS  1.0
                                Line 29: #define RECORDS       CPU_FREQ / SLOT * SECONDS
                                Line 30: #define SLOT          2500
                                Line 31: #define THRESHOLD     110
                                Line 32: #define MINTHRESHOLD  0
                                Line 33: #define MAX_IDLE      CPU_FREQ / SLOT * IDLE_SECONDS
                            </code></pre>

                            In the output <code>.csv</code> file, you may notice that most cache hits occur infrequently. However, in some cases, you may observe two (or more) cache hits occurring in close succession. In such cases, you may need to treat these multiple hits as a single hit.<br/><br/>

                            <span style="color: #D73F09;">Tip: You can use the <code>grep</code> command to filter the lines containing "hit" from the output file.</span><br/><br/>

                            Now your report should answer the following questions:<br/><br/>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How many 2D matrix multiplication operations were performed by the multiply program? What is the oracle?</li>
                                <li>Run the attack ten times. How many cache-hits occurred in each run?</li>
                                <li>What was the result from the most successful run and why?</li>
                                <li>What attack configurations were used in your most successful run?</li>
                                <li>What could be the reasons you were not able to obtain the correct number of cache-hits? Please explain your answer clearly and thoroughly—avoid vague responses, such as there are multiple programs running at the same time. If this is the reason, explain clearly how it could impact the Flush+Reload observations.</li>

                                    [Important Note] Make sure that your .csv file contains only cache-hits. 
                                    Including all cache-misses will substantially increase the submission size—potentially exceeding 10MB. 
                                    If your submission exceeds 10MB, 2 pts will be deducted.</span><br/>
